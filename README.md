# Cubic-Spline-Generator
This repository contains my custom code for generating cubic splines in Python. Cubic spline interpolation is used to approximate curves by connecting a finite set of points on the curve with cubic polynomials. The code example in this repository uses 11 evenly spaced points along the curve of the function *f(x) = cos(x)* within the range -4 to 4 to approximate the curve in that range. This code was utilized in the Qiskit Community Summer Jam 2020 - North Carolina hakathon that I participated in as a part of the [NCSSM Unicorns](https://github.com/code1word/nc-qc-hackathon-summer-2020) team while at the North Carolina School of Science and Mathematics. 

Python libraries required to run the code:
- numpy
- matplotlib
